# CRISPR-AID


This code is the custom code that was made to design the guideRNA sequences used in the following publication:
Multi-functional genome-wide CRISPR system for high throughput genotypeâ€“phenotype mapping
Lian*, J. Schultz, J.* Cao, M.* HamediRad, M.* and Zhao, H.

The guide RNA sequences were designed using CHOPCHOP tool (https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/) and the code presented here scores and sorts through the designed guides, and designs the homology arms required for successful targeting and potential modifications
